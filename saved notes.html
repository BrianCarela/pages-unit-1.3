<nav>
		Index <a href="Aboutme.html">About Me </a><a href="Location.html">Location </a><a href="Resume.html">Resume</a>
	</nav>

this is as a navigation above. When it's nav, any padding or margin or any changes like that, it affects around the entire nav as a WHOLE. If I want spacing in btwn the words of the nav, I have to isolate the items individually. My plan is to make it an unordered list, and then isolate `header li {` so it only affects those, and not my resume.

<center><ul>
	<li><a href="Index.html">Index </a></li>
	<li><a href="Aboutme.html">About Me </a></li>
	<li><a href="Location.html">Location </a></li>
	<li><a href="Resume.html">Resume</a></li>
</ul></center>

This is how I have it now, and it works. Above code has been copied to each page, removing the link that sends you to the page you're already on, for clarity

article {
	max-width: 600px;
	padding: 20px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

^ that stuff is to isolate the pieces of text i have for my About Me, Location, and ONLY the Work Experience section of my Resume. this width and padding gives it some space and if it's shrunk down on a smaller screen, the text lines up properly without having to scroll left/right, and the margin thingy makes it so there's no margin on the top or bottom, but the `auto` feature makes it so that on whatever screen it's on, it compensates for that, regardless of platform.

*FIND OUT WHAT COLOR PURPLE TO USE AS THE LINKS FOR "ABOUT ME". The purple color from the myspace.css file, the values IT'S HEX #87F, thanks Dash!!
uhhhh. It changed ALL links, not just the one in the body, but it affected the header too. WHY???? <strong> might help isolate it... sigh...
-didn't work. Settling to make it purple upon hovering over? but if that affects the header, I'm dead.

    alert("Javascript works!")
    </script>
    ^^^^ hint at Java

*If the scroll bar has to show up on the right side, then the entire website shifts left just a bit. I'll figure out how to compensate for that later

**next step is figuring out how to make my inline'd ul background color touch the edge of the goddamn page. left and right side is bugging me, and ALSO how to have the entire header BLEED OFF the page, I can ask nando later
